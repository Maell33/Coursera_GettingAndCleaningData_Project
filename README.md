# Getting and Cleaning data _ Coursera Project

This repository is a submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project (Coursera). 

Files: 
- CodeBook.md : a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations that has been performed to clean up the data. 
- run_analysis.R : a script that performs the data cleaning and the 5 steps required as decribed in the course project's definition: 
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- Final_data.txt : exported final data after performing all steps mentionned above
