The run_analysis.R script performs the 5 steps required in the course project's description. 
Here are the details about these setps as well as all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information. 

Preliminary setps: 
  - Dataset downloaded and unziped in folder called UCI HAR Dataset
  - Assign each data to variables:
      - features : The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
      - activites : list of the activities and their associated class (code)
      - subject_test : contains subject identification that perform the activity in test group
      - subject_train : contains subject identification that perform the activity in train group
      - X_test : contains recorded features test data
      - X_train : contains recorded features train data
      - y_test : contains associated activity class for test data 
      - y_train : contains associated activity class for train data
      
1. Merge the training and test sets to create one data set: 
test is created by merging subject_test, y_test and X_test using cbind()
train is created by merging subject_train, y_train and X_train using cbind()
combined data table is created by merging test and train table using rbind() to obtain one data set

2. Extract only measurements on mean and standard deviation
meanStd_only is obtained by only selecting the column names that contain mean or std
reducedSet is created by subsetting combined with only columns included in meanStd_only

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set instead of class
Replace the labels (code for acticity) in reducedSet table with the proper name of the activity (second column of activites table)

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
Labels column is remname activity
All Acc have been replaced by Accelerometer
All tBody have been replaced by TimeBody
All Gyro have been replaced by Gyroscope
All Mag have been replaced by Magnitude
All character starting by f have been replaced by Frequency
All character starting by t have been replaced by Time

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Final_data is created by sumarizing reducedSet with the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activities
Then Final_data has been exported as txt file
